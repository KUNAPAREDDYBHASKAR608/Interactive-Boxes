# Interactive-Boxes
 This project is a responsive front-end UI component for a "Bundle &amp; Save" e-commerce feature. It allows users to select from different product bundle offers (1, 2, or 3 pairs), customize each item by size and color, and view discounts and pricing details. Built using HTML and CSS, it provides a modern, interactive shopping experience.
